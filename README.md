# AstroReality Assignment w/ Scaling
A separate repo was made for this because the scaling effect is detrimental to the user experience when the images have different aspect ratios. I would recommend using this effect without scaling for optimal experience. However, for the purposes of this exercise, I also implemented this version with scaling.
